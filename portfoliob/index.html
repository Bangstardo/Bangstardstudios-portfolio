        <h2>🏆 Accomplishments</h2>

        <p>
          Basically my education. I owe all of it to my family. I majored in Financial Strategies and started a company Retasapp which is a success for it is what allowed me to walk the path of computer science. The sheer pain of the experience forged what today is and will be.

        <h2>Work History</h2>

        <h3>ThyssenKrupp</h3>
        <p>
          Functioned as a part of the accounts payable department. knowledgeable in SAP software. Focused in MIRO transactions.  
        </p>
        <h3>Colegio Lacari</h3>
        <p>
          This is where we actually started with web development by deploying our first wordpress site that handled clients and ran the marketing capmaigns using google ads and facebook ads. Here I realized I needed to learn ton more about CS.

        <h3>Tu Abasto</h3>
        <p>
          I ran a Fruits&Vegetables delivery company with a two buddies, a succesfull startup. sadly back then all was through whatsapp and I didn't have enough skills to make it a webapp. Life happened and that pretty much lives halted somewhere.
